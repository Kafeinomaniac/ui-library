## Specifications

> Normal state

Empty states can appear in different places (e.g. search results, auto complete…).

In Empty states we center components (e.g. The Voice, buttons…).

Actions are displayed directly after the message (e.g. buttons are not displayed at the bottom of the screen).

> Illustrations

Illustrations should have the max possible size (full width) and keep the W:H ratio when scalling WHILE not exceeding 1/3 of the screen height.

> Content
